        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.

            Formal education is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten, primary school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship.A right to education has been recognized by some governments and the United Nations. In most regions, education is compulsory up to a certain age. There is a movement for education reform, and in particular for evidence-based education with global initiatives aimed at achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 4, which promotes quality education for all.</p>

        <p class="sectionTag text-big"> Tranforming Education in Pakistan</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in Pakistan is overseen by the Federal Ministry of Education and the provincial governments, whereas the federal government mostly assists in curriculum development, accreditation and in the financing of research and development. Article 25-A of Constitution of Pakistan obligates the state to provide free and compulsory quality education to children of the age group 5 to 16 years. "The State shall provide free and compulsory education to all children of the age of five to sixteen years in such a manner as may be determined by law".

            The education system in Pakistan is generally divided into six levels: preschool (for the age from 3 to 5 years), primary (grades one through five), middle (grades six through eight), high (grades nine and ten, leading to the Secondary School Certificate or SSC), intermediate (grades eleven and twelve, leading to a Higher Secondary School Certificate or HSSC), and university programs leading to undergraduate and graduate degrees.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The Human Rights Measurement Initiative is one such organisation that measures the right to education in Pakistan. It calculates how well a country is doing to respect a right compared to what is possible at its level of income. In 2017, the HRMI found that the Pakistani government was only doing 43.3% of what was possible at its income level to ensure that everyone has a right to education. This statistic is based on primary and secondary school enrolment. Pakistan's government is doing only 46% of what is possible at its level of income for primary school enrolment, and 40.5% for secondary school enrolment[12]. This reveals that Pakistan has a long way to go in order to ensure that the right to education is being fulfilled sufficiently.</p>
